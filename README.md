# Maxwell-Compression
This is a type of theoretical compression using noise to restrucutre data into more compressible chunks. As of writing this, I have not found a way to achieve compression but the encoder.py and decoder.py show that using determnistic noise you can encode and decode abitrary data. I have tried, perlin (too similar), cryptographic noise, and pcg64 noise. Some are better than others at encoding based on seeds. I do think with the right noise and additional measures you could get a very high ratio of compression.




# how it works
It works like this. so you take a sequence of binary say "1101", then you generate a positon in the noise say "0" it checks if the generated string matches the sequence say the generated perlin string is "0110" then the program records to a tape "0" for no and then say position "1" is "1101" then it records "1" to the tape. All the decoder has to do is run back over the tape and take or leave chunks of data generated by the noise. to reconsturct the data
